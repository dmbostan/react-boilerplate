# React Boilerplate

Aloha, fellow front-end developer! 

If you are using React for building different prototypes like me, you probably
now the struggle of setting up a new ReactJS project with all the necessary 
tooling.

This project uses:
- Vite + React
- Typescript
- Vitest
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Yarn
- Feature-Driven Architecture

Feel free to use for your own projects :)
